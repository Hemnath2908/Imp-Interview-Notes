microservices are basically an SDLC in which large applications are build as a collection of small functional modules
Easy to enhance the update and interact fast
Independent production deployment


S.No.	Spring																			
1.	Spring is an open-source lightweight framework widely used to develop enterprise applications.	
2.	The most important feature of the Spring Framework is dependency injection.	
3. 	It helps to create a loosely coupled application.	
4. 	To run the Spring application, we need to set the server explicitly.	
5.	To run the Spring application, a deployment descriptor is required.	
6.	To create a Spring application, the developers write lots of code.	
7.	It doesn’t provide support for the in-memory database.	
8.	Developers need to write boilerplate code for smaller tasks.	
9.	Developers have to define dependencies manually in the pom.xml file.	

				Spring Boot
Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework, widely used to develop REST APIs.
The most important feature of the Spring Boot is Autoconfiguration.
It helps to create a stand-alone application.
Spring Boot provides embedded servers such as Tomcat and Jetty etc.
There is no requirement for a deployment descriptor.
It reduces the lines of code.
It provides support for the in-memory database such as H2.
In Spring Boot, there is reduction in boilerplate code.
pom.xml file internally handles the required dependencies


			deployment descriptor[Web.xml]
A web application's deployment descriptor describes the classes, resources and configuration of the application and how the web server uses them to serve web requests.

			boilerplate code
sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation

			API
API stands for Application Program Interface, and is basically a way for your program to interact with another program.

		Spring MVC
Fast , Easy and seperation of concern
MVC is a design pattern. which seperates the application into 3 different ways
	1. Model -> to represent the data
	2. View -> user can interact with the view
	3. Controller -> communicate with the business logic and prepare the view and model

Basic Flow :

Servlet dispatcher -> Handler Mapping -> Handler Adapter -> Controller -> Business Logic -> [DAO -> DB]
	Controller -> Handler Adapter[view name] -> Servlet dispatcher[http request] -> view Resolver

Once user click any button in browser or performed any action servlet dispatcher process the request to the Handler mapping. Handler Mapping will find which controller to call. Handler Adapter will call the controller and Controller will perform some business logics and return the view name[that is which front end to call]. Handler adapter will wrap the model and view together and  return to the servlet dispatcher. servlet dispatcher will convert the wrapped model and view into GUI through view Resolver.
\
1. what are static blocks and static initializers in Java ?
. Static blocks gets executed exactly once when the class is loaded
. Static blocks are executed even before the constructors are executed.

2.  How to call one constructor from the other constructor
		Using this() keyword
		this must be the first statement in the constructor
		we cannot use two this() methods in the constructor

3. What is method overriding in java ?
If we have methods with same signature (same name, same signature, same return type) in super class
and subclass then we say
subclass method is overridden by superclass. 

4. Agile methodology?[long term projects] 
It is an incremental or iterative process.
Understanding the requirent -> start developing the basic requirement and tested and demostrate to the customer or client -> and then enhance based on their feedback
Work based on the sprint

5. What is a scrum master?
Scrum masters are the facilitators of scrum, the lightweight agile framework with a focus on time-boxed iterations called sprints.
Product owner ===>       Developers      ====>   customer

In agile process once the developers completed the important features of an product, then product owner will demostrate to the customer for the feedback. customer will tell all the enhancement which is noted as product backlog 

what is jenkins?
Jenkins is a open-source automation tool for continous integration and continous deployment[CICD tool]
It will pull the latest code from git and build and end to end test
Scenario : Developers once pushed the code in git hib. jenkins will build that code and test that code using selenium. once testcases are success it will build as a package and posted it to the docker and from the running application in the docker will move to the server

					IOC
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.
 It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class.
 These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control.
 There are 2 types of IoC containers:
	BeanFactory 
	ApplicationContext 

6. What do you know about string?
String is class available java lang package
String is a final class. so it cant be extended
String is immutable it means we cannot change its value once the object is created

7. How do u create a string object?
	2 ways to create a string object 
		=> new keyword [String str = new String()]
		=> declaring a variable [String str = "name"]
		
8. Do u know how String internal store its reference in memory?
	String uses spl memory for restore string literals called String constant Pool
	With new keyword => It will check that the string literal is already present or not in the String constant pool, If it is not present , then it will create a reference inside the String constant pool and also create the reference in the heap memory
	Without new keyword => It will check that the string literal is already present or not in the String constant pool, If it is not present , then it will create a reference inside the String constant pool only.
	
String Builder And String Buffer
	String Buffer is synchronized and thread safe
	String Builder is non synchronized and not a thread safe
synchronized  -> Thread concept it will wait until the current task gets end
unsynchronized -> executed parallely



9. Do u know how to create a custum immutable class?
	=> It must be a final class 
	=> Access specifiers must be private
	=> should provide only getter method. there is no setter method

10. Diff btw classNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError?
	  = > An exception that occurs when u try to load a class at runtime using Class.getName(), if the mention class is not present it will class not found exception
	
	NoClassDefFoundError => An exception that occurs when the class is found at the compile time and which is missing at the runtime. then w=this exception will occurs

11. What is an exception in java and to handle it?
	An exception is a failure condition during the execution of a program
	We handle it by using try catch block

12. Types of Exceptions?
	Checked Exceptions -> Exceptions which are checked by compiler itself -> Example[if we want to read a file ,at compile time itself it will suggest here exception might occur]
	Unchecked Exceptions -> occurs at runtime -> Example[ArrayOutOfBoundExecption]
	2 types in checked Exceptions -> fully checked exception -> fully check the parent and child class
								 partially checked exception -> only checks the parent class
	
13. Is Finally block always executed ?
	Finally block is always executed even if the exception occured.
	In one scenario Finally will not execute. by using System.Exit(1) in try catch block, because it will terminate the running jvm 
	
14. What is Http?
	Http is a protocol is to communicate between client to server model

15.What are the http methods?
	Post, Get, Put, Delete, Head, Option, Patch

16. Diff between  GET and POST?
	GET -> Data goes with URL. Not safe
	Post -> Data goes with Request body . completely safe
	
17. What is JOINS and types of JOINS?
	Joins is to combine two or tables to fetch more datas
	Inner Joins -> to fetch common data 
	Left Joins -> to fetch whole data from left table and common data from right table it is used
	Right Join -> to fetch whole data from right table and common data from left table it is used
	
18. What are the Bean scope in spring?
	Singleton -> single instance will be created per spring IOC container
	Prototype -> multiplw instance will be created
	request -> scope of the bean will be to the particular http request
	session -> scope of the bean will be to the particular session
	global -> scope of bean will be global to session
	
19. What is RESTFUL webservice ?
	Rest is an architectural design pattern and it is used for building services that could be light wight, scalable and easy maintainable

20. Rest services are stateless?
	Because it supports the Http protocol - and http protocol is stateless. So rest is also stateless
	Stateless means when you send request from the client to server, the server does not hold or store any info about the client

21. things important in sending request?
	Resource, Request Header, request body, responsebody, statuscode


22. Diff between @Controller and @RestController
@Controller is used to declare common web controllers which can return HTTP response but @RestController is used to create controllers for REST APIs which can return JSON.
In Spring MVC, both @Controller and @RestController annotations are used to define web controllers as per MVC Design pattern. 
A controller is responsible for handling HTTP request and returning HTTP response to client.
@RestController instead of returning HTML, you will probably like to return JSON or XML 

23. @RequestMapping and @GetMapping @ PostMapping @Bean 
The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods. It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types.

24. To build Rest APi what are all the annotations used?
	@Entity  -> To Map the model[DAO] class to the database. over the model class
	@RestController -> To indicate the java class as a controller
	@RequestMapping -> label
	@Autowired -> used to define a injection to our project. Used for DI concept
	@PostMapping("/url") -> Http method -> to create 
	@GetMapping("/url") -> Get method -> put mapping and delete mapping
	@Service -> used as a service class. inside that we use all the business logics
	@PathVariable("") -> used to capture the value we passed in the url
	@Valid -> 
	@RequestBody -> used to capture the object of the resource which we were passing to the client side

24. How will u DO the CRUD operations?

25. What is Lambda expression 
	It is an annonymous function [a function/ method which has no name]
 What is functional interface?
 A function interface should have only one abstract method. other than that it may have n number of static methods and n number of default methods
 
Tight coupling - > One object should depend on another object
					If one object is modified its dependend object should also modify
					reduces the flexiblity of code
					Not recommended
Loose Copling  -> One object should not depend on another object
				  If one object is modified its dependend object should not modify
Spring boot imp ques:

1. What is spring?
Spring a framework which is used to create a light weight[consume less memory] and loosely coupled enterprise application in java
It provides pre defined API for data operations and rest ful web[integrating one appl to another] services and microservices and security
It is mainly for develop back end application

2. Features of spring?
	1. Pre-defined Templates like JDBC Templates and hibernate templates
	Templates are the classes which reduces the boiler plate code
	2. Loose coupling - it can be implemented by using layers mechanism. If one module or layer is modified then it will not affect the another module is called loose coupling
	3. Light weight 
	4. easy to test - Junit
	5. RAD - Rapid application Development

3. Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a mechanism which is used to inject the dependency class into dependent class
Simply linking or injecting the object to the dependent class
Basically, when we write any program sometimes its needed to create a object of some class, so dependency injection helped us to object creation process automatically by its own

4. types of Dependency Injection [DI]
	1. Constructor Injection - > object is created by using parameters constructor and values are injected
	2. Setter Injection -> default constructor is used and setter method is called
	3. Feild Injection -> New type of injection, used by @Autowired
	4. Circular injection -> one class is depend on another class in a circular manner
	5. Lookup method injection -> spl case , occurs in case of scope mechanism

5. IOC in spring
IOC stands for inversion of controller
Basically the spring container uses dependency injection for managing application components by creating objects wiring them together along with configuring and managing their entire life cycle

Types of IOC 
	1. Bean Factory  - is a fatory class that contains a collection of beans. It instanciates the bean whenever asked by the client
	2. Application Context - is interface is build on top of bean factory
	
	
6. Spring configuration File?
It is an xml file which contains the information of classes and how the class to be configured and linking with each other
it is also called xml configuration file
EX : <bean id="emp1" class="com.emp.service">
		<property name ="empType">
			<value>exort</value>
			</property></bean>

7. Spring bean? -> nothing but an object
An object which is entirely controlled by the spring IOC container is called spring bean
Basically it will created by the help of configuration code which is supply by user to IOC container

8. Different between Constructor and setter injection ?
	Constructor injection -> partial injection is not possible
							if any modification new instance will be created
							if bean have many property then we prefer constructor injection
							it does not override the setter property
	Setter injectection -> partial inject is possible
							if any modification new instance will not created
							if bean have few property then we prefer Setter injection
							It override the constructor injectection

9. Bean scope in spring
Scope means how long the object is present in the container
	1. Singleton - create only one object
	2. Prototype - create a object whenever we creating with new keyword
	3. Request - if a browser makes any req an object is created in the container once the response is commited the object will destroy in the container
	4. Session - http session. simply login logout
	
10. Bean wiring?
Bean wiring is simply linking two object
When the bean are combined together inside the spring container is called bean wiring
The spring container should know what beans are needed and how the beans are dependent each other while wiring

11. Autowired in spring different modes it have?
The spring framework can inject the dependencies automatically
The IOC container will first detect those dependencies and relation between the beans and then it will inject automatically this process is called autowiring
It have 5 modes	
	1. No 
	2. byName
	3. byType
	4. constructor
	5. autodetect

12. diff between @Autowired and @inject
Both are used for same purpose @Autowired is used to auto wiring[inject dependencies automatically in spring framework
Both annotations used in spring framework
@Inject is a part of CDI (Context and Dependency Injection)

13. Diff between @Componenet and @Bean
@Component -> The class will be autodetect using class path scanning
			  It is class level annotations
			  configuration annotation is not required
			  @Controller, @Service and @Repository are specialization in @Componenet
@Bean -> used to explicitly creating a bean rather than spring automatically do it
		 It is method level annotation
		 Configuration annotation is required
		 No specialization
	
14. Types of IOC container in spring
	1. Bean Factory  - xml configuration
	2. ApplicationContext - it supports multiple like annotation, multi container system 
	
15. use of @Required Annotations in spring
	@Required is applied to bean property setter methods
	It will annotate in the top of setter methods. used to if we dont set any value for setter methods means default will take null. but we use @Required it will all us to set the value for the setter method

16. use of @Autowired in spring
	It is used to link/inject two beans inside the Spring container
	Mostly recommended using field injection
	If we have service layer or repository layer or Entity layer we can link one layer with another then can use @Autowired
	
17. use of @Qualifier in spring 
	When we create more than one bean of the same type and wire only one of them with a property we can use @Qualifier along with @Autowired to remove the ambiguity by specifying which exact bean should wired 

Microservices : 

1. microservices architecture
microservices are basically an SDLC in which large applications are build as a collection of small functional modules
	It is an architecture to develop an complex application
	These are build as a small and independent services
	These services communicate with each other through API like soap and rest
	It will enabled modular and decoupled systems

2. Benefits of using microservices architecture?
	1. Scalablity
	2. Resilence 
	3. Flexiblity, Faster development cycle
	4. Easier to maintainable
	
3. SOLID Principles
	Group of object oriented Priciple is called solid principle
	Using this principle developer can write a Readable,maintainable and clean code
	Single Responsible Principle[SRP] : Each class and module in a program should focus on a single tasks
	open-closed principle[OCP] : Software entities(classes, modules and methods) should open for extension but closed for modification
	Liskov Substitution Principle[LSP] : Object of its superclass should be able to replaced with object of its subclass without breaking its behavious of the program
	Interface Segregation Principle[ISP] : client should not be forced to depend upon interface they do not use
	Dependency Inversion Principle : use of interface and dependency injection to decoupled modules and make them more reuseable and testable

4. Spring cloud and what are its key feature [Need to learn more about this channels -> Java guides , Coler Ulagam]
	Spring cloud is a framework built on top of the spring boot
	used for development and deployment of microservices
	Key feature : service discovery, registration, load balancing, circuit breaking, distributed configuration, API gateway and distributed tracing
	
5. What is service discovery  and how it is acheived in spring cloud
	The process of dynamically locating and communicating with services
	In spring cloud, service discovery is acheived using netflix eureka or consul
	Allow services to register themselves and discover other services, enabling communication between microservices
	@EnableEurekaServer
	server.port = 6666
	eureka.client.registerWithEureka =false
	eureka.client.fetchRegistry=false
	
	EurekaServer -> dependency for server
	EurekaDiscoveryClient -> dependency for client

6. Explain the role of API gateway in microservices
	Act as a single entry point for client request to microservices
	Handling dynamic routing and load balancing
	The Gateway library is used to implement the Gateway API
	Support integration with Service discovery and Authentication
	No hard code url
	No cost cutting concern
	Authentication
	Authorization
	Static/dynamic routing
Common Gateways in market
Spring cloud zuul - open source
Apgee API Management
AWS API Gateway
Azure Api Fateway

API gateways -> Routing traffic
			-> Simplifying complexity
			-> security [authentication/ authorztion]
			-> managing scalablity
			
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.id = order-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.uri = lb://order-service  -> lb : loadbalanced 
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.predicates = Path=/order/**
 


	
7. What is circuit breaking and how it is implemented using spring cloud
	It is a pattern that prevents the cascading failures in microservices
	Circuit breaking is implemented using netflix hystrix lib[older one] and Resillence4j
	Monitor the health of dependent services and if failures occurs, open the circuit to stop sending the request
	It ensuring the overall system stability
	
8. What is load balancing and how it is handled in microservices 
	Distribution of client request across multiple instance of a service 
	Spring cloud integrates with load balancer like netflix ribbon / cloud load balancer
	These are client side load balancing
	Handle load distribution without manual configuration

9. Tools to aggregate microservices log files
	ELK Stack[ELasticSearch, LogStack, kibana]
	Splunck
	Fluented

10. What is distributed tracing and how it is implemented in spring cloud
	It is a technique used to track and monitor request as they flow through multiple microservices
	It is implemented through integration wit tracking system - zipkin
	Sleuth used for tracking information across microservices, transferred to zipkin server Using zipkin client

11. purpose of spring cloud config and how does it work
	It is centralized management of configuration properties for microservices
	It uses configuration in a version- control repository and provide a configuration server
	Microservices can retrive their congiguration information from the server at runtime, enabling dynamic and centralized configuration

12. What are different types of Spring cloud config
	1. Local File System : Configuration property file can be stored in a local file system. the configuration files typically yml file or property final
	2. GIT : microservices can retrve the configuration from specific GIT repository, allowing for version control and easy management
	3. Harshi corp valult : Configuration files stored securily in vault, and spring cloud config server can retrive them using authentication and authorztion mechanism

13. diff approaches for inter-service communication in microservices
	It includes synchronous communication through Http/Rest api
	Asynchrous communication using message brokers like Rabbit Mq and apache kafka
	Event driven communication using event buses or pub/sub mechanism

14. Service orchestration and service choreography
	Service orchestration is a centralized approch where central components controls and coordinates the execution flow of microservices
	service choreography is a decentralized apporoach where microservices collabarate with each other, without a central contoller
	Service orchestration provides a more controlled and coordinated workflow 
	Service choreography gathers flexiblity to individual services

15. Role of container and container orchestration platform [imp Ques]
	It is a light weight and portable enviornment for packaging and deploying microservices
	Consistency across different enviornment
	orchestration platforms such as kubernet, Docker swam, automate the management of container at scale
	They handle task like deployment, scaling, service discovery, load balancing and fault tolerence in a distributed enviornment

16. Spring Profiles
	allowing us to map our beans to different profiles — for example, dev, test, and prod.
First need to create a new profile file or yml file.The name of the file should be ex : application-qa.properties -> Property file -> spring.profile.active=qa 
ex: application-prod -> Property file -> spring.profile.active=prod

17.swagger 
For Rest api swagger document is very critical
input and output
For SOAP webservices WSDL is the contract document, same for REST API swagger is the contract document
Contract document means it contains the information about what input to provide and what output is getName


imp Annotations in spring boot
@Component -  it tells the spring container to automatically create a spring bean
			It indicate that the annotated class is a spring bean /component class

@Autowired - is used to inject the bean automatically
			is used in constructor injection, setter injection , field injection

@Qualifier - is used in conjuction with autowired to avoid confusion when we have two or more beans configured for same type

@Primary - to give higher preference to a bean where there are multiple beans of a same type

@Bean - It indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the spring container
		It is usually declared in Configuration class to create spring bean definition

Stereotype annotations -  These are used to create spring beans automatically in the application context(Spring Ioc container)
					The main stereotype annotation is @Component.
					By using this spring provides more stereotype meta annotation such as @Controller @Repository @Service
@Service - used to create a spring bean at service layer
@Repository - used to create spring bean for the repositories at the DAO layer
@Controller - used to create spring bean at controller layer

@Lazy - By default spring creates all singleton beans eagerly at the startup/ bootstrapping of the appl context
	 we can load the spring bean lazily (on-demand) using @Lazy
	 we can used with the help of @Configuration @Componenet @Bean annotation
	 Eager initialization is recommended : to avoid and detect all possible errors immediately rather than at runtime

@Scope - is used to define the scope of the bean
		we use by the help of @Componenet or @Bean definition
		4 types of scope -> Singleton , Prototype, request, session

@SpringBootApplication - It is the combination of @SpringBootConfiguration @ComponenetScan @AutoEnableConfiguration

@ComponenetScan - is used to scan the base package and sub packages which is annotated with @Componenet


GIT :
It is a distributed version control to monitor ur team or work with our team together in same workspace
imp Commands 
1. git clone - Download repository from cloud like git hub to ur computer for develepment
2. git commit - once changed the code will again save the code to local repository 
3. git push - changes of code to push from local repository to cloud
4.git pull - pull the latest code
5. git branch - create seperate working branch
6. git merge - merge changes to main branch 


Git and git hub
Git is a software which is downloaded in local system
Github is a service which is cloud based
Git is maintain by linux
Github is maintain by microsoft

git init -> git add "fileName" -> git commit -m "message" git remote add origin https://github.com/git -> git push -u origin master 
	git add . -> add all the files
	git checkout -b "new" -> to create a new branch
	git checkout  new -> to switch to new branch
	git checkout master -> to switch to master

JPA ques :

1. What is ORM?
	ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping
	It is a technique to creating a bridge between object oriented program and relational database
	It is mainly for db operations like insert, delete, update and select
	Every operations needs to be in object format

2. What is JPA
	JPA -> Java persistence API 
	It is one of the ORM specifications
	It is a java specification used to persist data between relational database and object
	It acts as bridge between java xlass and relational database
	
3. Explain Mapping Rule in JPA
	we define Entity(POJO) class for one Table
	we define one variable for one column
	Then the object is converted into one Row 

4. Diff between JPA and Hibernate[imp]
   JPA is a specification given by sunmicrosystem, now part of oracle
   Hibernate is a JPA implementation

5. JDBC vs Hibernate?
	Both are designed to communicate with RDMS using java code
	JDBC - JDBC is a tool
	In jdbc we need to write a code to map the schema of the database
	Jdbc supports Sql queries which is dependent to database
	Hibernate - Is a framework
	It performs automatic object mapping with minor configurations
	It supports HQL which is database independent

6. adv of using JPA?
	Database independent
	Easy to develop a database operations
	JPQL/HQL support [JPQL -> Java Persistence Query Language/ HQL -> Hibernate Query Language]
	Type(datatype) and parameters handling

7. what is spring data or spring boot data jpa repository?
	There 3 string boot data repository
		1. CrudRepository
		2. PagingAndSortingRepository
		3. JPARepository
	all the 3 are interface, its implemented class is generated by spring boot at runtime

8. diff between pagingAndSorting and JPA repository?
	Jpa repository is working only for relational database
	like mysql, oracle,postres etc
	PagingAndSortingRepository and CrudRepository is works for both Sql and no sql database
	like mangoDB etc
	In pagingAndSortingRepository we can also perform pagination and sortings

9. pre-defined methods given by the Repository interfaces?
	-> save()	 - to save data 										-> existById() 
	-> delete()	 - to delete data										-> findAll(sort)	
	-> findById() - to find a particular data by primarykey				-> findAll(pageable)
	-> findAll() - to fetch all the data
	-> deleteById() - to delete a particular data by primarykey
	-> count() - to get the row count

10. what is Entity class and commonly used annotations for this
	A class which is mapped with the database table is called entity class
	we can also called it as POJO class(Plain Old Java Object)
	It must with mapped with Database table using JPA annotations like
	@Entity  @Table(name="")   @Column(name= "") @Id  etc

11. what is the naming convention for finder methods in spring data repository interface?
	The naming convention of finder methods is pre-defined keyword followed by variable name in java class
	syntax : <ReturnType> findBy<variableAndkeyword>(DataType params);
	Ex : List<User> findByLastName(String LastName);

12. How can we create a custom repository in spring data Jpa
	we can create our own custom repository by extending any one of following below
		Respository  - > if we dont want to use any methods which is provided by Crud/jpa repository then we go for Repository, because it is an empty repository  
		CrudRepository
		PagingAndSortingRepository
		JPARepository
	
13. What is pagingAndSortingRepository
	By using this repository, we can sort the data either in asc or desc order
	Also we can convert the record or print the record page by page [pagination]
	This repository extends crudRepository

14. @Query used for?
	@Query Annotations is to write a custom query or user/programmer defined query
	By using this we can write JPQL/HQL query 
	JPQL/HQL query  means query which is written by the class and the variable name rather than the DB table and column name
	Here JPQL is a specification and HQL is a implementation

15. types of query can be implemented using @Query annotation
	we can write select and non-select[update/delete but not insert]operations
	we can write both JPQL and native sql queries
	But when we using @Query with non-select operations like update or delete we need to additionally add @Modify annotation. Because @Query annotation default it will take select query

16. Example of Using @Query annotation with JPQL?
	@Query("Select e from Employee emp where emp.name = :name")
	List<Employee> getEmployeName(String name);
		-> Must defined inside repository class
		-> Must be a abstract class
		-> Must check JPQL/HQL syntax

17. What are collection Mapping supported by JPA?
	JPA supports collections like Set,List, Map
	We need to add @ElementCollection over variable
	It create one child table with 2/3 column
	
	Key column -> foreign Key column
	index column -> Position of value in collection
	Element column -> Actual Data of collection
	
	For Set collection table is created with 2 columns
	For List/Map collections, table is created with 3 columns

18. What is Platform Transaction Manager?
	It is an interface that extends TransactionManager
	It is the central interface in spring transaction infrastructure
	It enables @Transactional Annotations which do commit in case of success and rollback in case of exception/failure

19. How to enable spring Data Jpa
	In spring boot comes with auto configurable, just add the dependency in pom.xml file -> spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
	we need to write some comfiguration in application.property file to get the data source 
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:thin:oracle:@localhost.port
	spring.datasource.username=
	spring.datasource.password=
	spring.datasource.driver-class-name=

20. Diff between findById() and getOne() [imp ]
	findById() present in CRUD Repository whereas getOne() present in JPARepository
	If data is not found in findById() method it will return null, means it return type as Optional<T> class
	If data is not found in getOne() method, it will throw an exception called EntityNotFoundException
	
21. use of dialet and give some ex?
	It is a class defined in Jpa
	It generates SQL at runtime based on our operations, like calling save method and generate insert method 
	If we move from one database to another db then we need to modify dialet database property in property file
	ex : oracle10gDialet, MySql8Dialet, PostgresDialet etc

22. Fetch Type in JPA [imp]
	It is used for select operations for Association mapping or collection mapping
	Fetch types are EAGER and LAZY
	-> EAGER - Load parent Entity along with its associate child entities from DB table on select operations
	-> LAZY - Load parent Entity along from DB table on select operations, Later calling child get() methods load the child entity
	Fetch type is enum internally

23. default fetch type in jpa?
	There is no default value for fetch type. It depends on operations we do
	LAZY for : one to many or many to many also for Element collection
	EAGER : One to one and one to many

24. How can we see generated SQL at console/log?
	At default JPA will not show generated sql[query]
	we need to add the property to view them - > spring.jpa.show-sql= true 
	At default it is false
	
25. Types of JOINS supported by JPA?
	-> Inner Join | Join - Gets commonly connected rows from both tables
	-> Outer Join 
	1. Left Outer Join | Left Join - Get all row from left table and common rows from right table
	2. Right Outer Join | Right Join - Get all row from right table and common rows from left table
	3. Full Outer Join | Full Join - Get all rows from both tables

26. Provide both Sql and JPQL/HQL joins syntax
	SQL - > Select <columns> From <ParentTable> <p> [Join type] <ChildTable><c> on <p><pk> = <c><ck> where <condition>
	Ex: Select name from Employee emp Join EmployeeDetails empDetails on (emp.sno = empDetails.s.no) where emp.location = 'chennai'
	JPQL/HQL - > Select <variable> From <ParentClass><P> [JoinType] <P><HasVariable> As<C> Where Condition
	Ex: Select name from EmployeeClass emp JOIN EmployeeChildClass ECC

Collections Ques : 
What are all the collecctions used in your projects
List -> ArrayList -> maintains insertion order 2. allows duplicate values 3. allows n number of null values 4. Not a thread safe
	 -> LinkedList -> maintains insertion order 2. allows duplicate values 3. allows n number of null values 4. Not a thread safe
Set -> HashSet -> doesnt maintain insertion order2. doesnt allow duplicate value 3. allow only one null value
	-> LinkedHashSet -> maintain insertion order 2. doesnt allow duplicate value 3. allow only one null value
	-> TreeSet -> sort the value in asc or desc
Map -> HashMap -> doesn’t maintain insertion order. 2. doesn’t allow duplicate value and key 4.doesnt allow duplicate null value and key
	-> LinkedHashMap ->  maintain insertion order. 2. doesn’t allow duplicate value and key 4.doesnt allow duplicate null value and key
	
2. Diff between Set and list 
if u want to store duplicates then we can use List 
if u want to store unique values then we can use Set

3. ArrayList and LinkedList
Both are implementation of List interface
ArrayList is better for storing and accesing data	2. bit shifting is required
LinkedList is better for manupulating data 3. no bit shifting is required because its already know the previous element value

4. Final list
we can modify but we cannot reassign it
ex -> List<String> list = new Array<>();  list.add("A"); list.add("B"); adding / modifying is possible but list = new LinkedList<>() -> it is not possible

5. why set doesnot allow duplicates
Set internally uses map interface to store the value. while adding value in set. the value will be stored as a key, whereas map doesn’t support duplicate values 

6. ForEach -> Only forward direction and removal is not possible
   Iterator -> Only forward direction and removal is possible
   ListIterator -> bi directional and removal is possible

Java 8 features
	Lambda expressions -> Lambda expression helps us to write our code in functional style, It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data     
         	              from collection.
						  Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
						  Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
						  Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.
						  
	Method references -> used to refer method of functional interface ,  Syntax ::
	Functional interfaces, -> it is interface which contains only one abstract methods and n number of static and default methods
	Stream API -> 
	Base64 Encode Decode,
	Optional class
	Collectors class
	ForEach() method
	Parallel Array Sorting
